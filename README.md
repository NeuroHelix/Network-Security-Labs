Can you hack it? Packet tracer labs for a variety of vulns.
## READ ME FIRST ##

You will need cisco packet tracer to run these lab files. Download it here: https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer

This repo is where I will be uploading different packet tracer netowrk topologies. Many will be intentionally vulnderable CTF's that I have made, or some might just be topologies I like. Feel free to break 'em, add to 'em, or use
them in your studies. You can collect them all! Constructive criticism is always welcome. Good luck with your studies!
